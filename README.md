# Sprocket-Central-Customer-Trends-Analysis
This is a KPMG Virtual Internship addressing the business task to determine customer trends and behavior of a company that specializes in the production of bikes and accessories.
This internship has helped me develop the thought process of solving a problem as a data analyst and also built my self-confidence to analyze a real-world dataset for an organization or client, it also serves as my second project.

I carried out Data Quality Assessment where I was tasked with drafting an email to the client identifying all data quality issues, how it was resolved and offered professional advice on data collection.

I also gathered insights from the datasets and created a PowerPoint presentation which outlined the approach to identify which of the new customers to target, explaining the three phases; Data Exploration, Model Development and Interpretation. I learnt how to study customers past behavior by using RFM (Recency, Frequency, and Monetary) analysis to quantitatively rank them to identify the best customers and perform targeted marketing campaigns.

Finally, I created a dashboard based on the new customer list that displayed the data summary, potential customers to target and their demographics. 

I did the data cleaning and analysis on Microsoft Excel and exported the data to Tableau for Visualization
